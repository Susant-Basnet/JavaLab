# Data Types in Java
Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. There are two types of data types in Java:

1-Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
2-Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.


### There are 8 types of primitive data types:

-boolean data type
-byte data type
-char data type
-short data type
-int data type
-long data type
-float data type
-double data type

### Boolean Data Type
The Boolean data type is used to store only two possible values: true and false. This data type is used for simple flags that track true/false conditions.

The Boolean data type specifies one bit of information, but its "size" can't be defined precisely.

Example: Boolean one = false

### Byte Data Type
The byte data type is an example of primitive data type. It isan 8-bit signed two's complement integer. Its value-range lies between -128 to 127 (inclusive). Its minimum value is -128 and maximum value is 127. Its default value is 0.

The byte data type is used to save memory in large arrays where the memory savings is most required. It saves space because a byte is 4 times smaller than an integer. It can also be used in place of "int" data type.

Example: byte a = 10, byte b = -20
